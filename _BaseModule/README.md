# Gas station pylon prices

This Write Everywhere module adds layouts that contains information about current prices of the 3 first products sold at a gas station. Since all gas stations only sell Petrochemicals at this moment, so the first price will always be the Petrochemicals sell price and the others will show fully as hyphens.

Now also shows at each line an icon representing the resource being sold at that price, the atlas is replaceable as well by following WE rules: Export the atlas from this mod; Move to `imageAtlases` folder; Edit the images; Replace it at Prefab Templates Setup tab on WE window.

All price totems from vanilla game gas stations have layouts in this pack. The font used to display the prices is the **_DEFAULT_LED**, replaceable at Prefab Templates Setup tab at WE window (circled W button).

Tip: you can select the formatting locale for the numbers in the Write Everywhere tab at game Options menu.
