# Gas station pylon prices

This Write Everywhere module adds layouts that contains information about current prices of the 3 first products sold at a gas station. Since all gas stations only sell Petrochemicals at this moment, so the first price will always be the Petrochemicals sell price and the others will stay zeroed.

All price totems from vanilla game gas stations have layouts in this pack. The font used to display the prices is the **_DEFAULT_LED**

Tip: you can select the formatting locale for the numbers in the  Write Everywhere tab at game Options menu.
